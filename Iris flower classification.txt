Iris flower classification in machine learning using KNN

K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a simple, supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the k most similar instances in the training data to a new instance and then predicting the label of the new instance based on the labels of the k nearest neighbors.

KNN is a good choice for iris flower classification because it is simple to implement and interpret. It is also a robust algorithm that is not sensitive to outliers.

To classify iris flowers using KNN, we first need to split the iris flower dataset into training and test sets. The training set will be used to train the KNN model, and the test set will be used to evaluate the performance of the model.

Once we have split the dataset, we can create a KNN classifier. We need to specify the number of neighbors, k, to use. A higher value of k will make the model more robust to noise, but it will also make the model less flexible.

We can then train the KNN model on the training set. Once the model is trained, we can use it to predict the species of the flowers in the test set.
